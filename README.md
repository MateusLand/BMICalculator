## Features
- Calculate BMI: Users can input their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters), and the app calculates their BMI.
- Display BMI Result: After calculation, the app displays the user's BMI on a second screen along with a classification (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obesity, Extreme Obesity).
- Recalculate: Users can recalculate their BMI by going back to the main screen, where the fields for weight and height are cleared.
